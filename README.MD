# Cine Soon

Cine Soon is a movie browsing and search app for iOS devices. It allows users to browse through a list of movies or search for specific movies by title. The app displays the movie's poster, title, release date, and a brief overview when available. Users can also view more detailed information about a movie by clicking on its poster or title.

In the app, users can save their favorite movies to a separate list for easy access. They can also change the language of the app to either English , Turkish and Russian and enable dark mode for a more comfortable viewing experience at night.

Cine Soon utilizes the CoreData, Kingfisher, and DropDown libraries to provide a smooth and efficient user experience. It is built using the latest version of Xcode and requires iOS 14.0 or higher to run.
